README for LibLC

LibLC is an opensource collection of useful Document Service Components (DSC) contributed from 
a variety of sources, and normalized into a standard build structure using Maven 2.

Current Modules
---------------

1. Twilio SMS (artifact: sms).  A DSC to allow LC processes to send SMS messages via Twilio.com.


Contributing
------------

If you wish to contribute, please contact Matt MacKenzie (matt .. uberity .. com).  Everyone is
welcome, but keep in mind a couple of things:

1. You MUST be willing to give your code away using either the MIT, BSD or Apache License.
2. You cannot include in your build any software that is not open sourced, or otherwise licensed
in an unrestrictive manner.  The idea is that LibLC is entirely unencumbered and can be used by
anyone who wishes for free.
3. You MUST be willing to use Maven.

To prepare your project, please consider the sms module as a template of how you organize src and 
resources.
